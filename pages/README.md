## :mega: News
 * The final submission deadline is on friday 8.3. at 23:59. There are no time extensions available. Good luck on the exam week!
 * If you find typos or other errors on the course pages, please submit pull request with a fix.

## :notebook: Labtool

 * [https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/labtool/](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/labtool/)
 * Sign in with your Univeristy of Helsinki account.

## IRC and telegram
The course IRC channel is **#tiralabra** @IRCnet.
The telegram channel can be found [here](https://t.me/tkttiralabra).

Generally the TG and IRC chats are linked together, so the course assistant is available through both channels.

## Guidance

* Primarily the course assistant will be available on fridays 15-18 in class BK107.
* You may also contact the course assistant through [Telegramissa](https://t.me/tkttiralabra) or IRC.
* E-mail also works.

### Algorithm workshop

* The primary guidance for the course is organized in conjunction with the [algorithm workshop](https://courses.helsinki.fi/en/tkt20000/126082463) on fridays. BK107 15-18.
* You can attend the algorithm workshow at other times as well to get help with data structures or algorithms. The assistant may not be able to help you with course specific things other than on fridays.

## Demonstration

* Time and place TBD. Hopefully a doodle questionnaire will be sent out after the start of the course with potential times.
* **Mandatory!** Contact the course assistant if you can not make the Demo session. The demo session is mandatory to get a passing grade!
* All projects will be loaded onto a presentation machine, which you may use for the demonstration.
* Alternatively you can present with your own laptop. In this case you may want to arrive early to test that the laptop works properly with the projector.
* Approximately (at most) 5 minutes per project.
* Slides are not required for the presentation and generally not recommended unless you have a specific reason to use slides.

## Example projects

* [Saskelis project](https://github.com/saskeli/NonogramSolver_TiRa) **Note:** that te course has changes somewhat after this project was made.
* Jussi was also kind enough to allow his [project](https://github.com/yussiv/Compress) to be provided as an example. But stated that the project was pretty minimum effort.
* Both of these still have a good project structure.

## :trophy: Conduct of the course
Based on the number of study points (4) offered, the expected amount ot work to complete the course should be approximately 107 hours. Plan to spend 15-20 hours on the course every week.

On this course the student creates a program that solves some sort of problem. For creating the problem the student will apply suitable data structures and algorithms. The problem to solve is selected by the student with the help of the course assistant. A passing (or even good) grade does not require developing an algorithm from scratch. A student may develop their own algorithm(s) if desired. The main point of the course is that the created program works correctly and efficiently. The size of problem instances and required efficiency will depend on the topic, and will be decided with help from the course assistant. Some example topics can be found [here](aiheet.md).

The cours will be partially done online. All weekly submissions will be done online. The only mandatory meetings for the course are the firts lecture and the demo session. More information on the submissions can be found [here](palautukset.md).

The program will be written in a language **approved by the course assistant**. Almost always Java.

The primary goal of the course is to learn to implement data structures and algoritms. For this reason all required data structures and algorithms will have to be implemented by the student. Generally only primal types, arrays and strings may be used, everything else has to be implemented using these. Other tools such as IO and GUI libraries may be used. **Data structures from standard libraries (such as ArrayList, HashMap and so on from Java) or algorithms (Collections.sort...) May not be used in the final submission**, and it is suggested that the imports for these are completely removed. If you are unsure if a particular class/library is allowed, ask the course assistant.

Generally a good approach to incrementally complete a project has been to first implement the core functionality of the program by using ready-made data structures and algorithms (queues, heaps, sorting algorithms). That is, it may be a prudent to first quickly implement the core functinality and later replace library implementations with self-made ones. I.e. replace implementtions defined by interfaces with data structures and algorithms made from scratch. This is the assumed working idea for the project timeline. If you want to approach the project in a different way, you should decide on prgress milestones for the project with the course assistant during the first week of the course.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Grounds for grading
* Program: 30 p
   * Functionality and features 10 p
   * Testing 10 p
   * Code documentation (JavaDoc and self documenting) 5 p
   * Clarity of the code 5 p

* Documentation 10 p
   * Topic definition 2p
   * Implementation 3p
   * Testing 3p (unit- and performance-!)
   * User guide 2p

* During the course 20p
    * Code reviews 2 * 2p = 4p
    * Weekly submissions 1p +  5 x 3p = 16 p

(All in all 60 p)

For a passing grade the project needs to contain self-made implementations for datastructures and algorithms. Every project is separately graded. Below are typical gradings based on points.

* 5: 50 p
* 4: 45 p
* 3: 40 p
* 2: 35 p
* 1: 30 p
